# twad - terminal wad launcher

![demo](demo.gif)

If you love __DOOM__ and you love your terminal, then twad might be for you. It is a terminal based WAD manager and launcher for ZDoom engine games. At it's core twad lets you set up a multitude of WAD file combinations, store them and launch them with the press of a button.

There are already great alternatives to manage and launch your WADs out there for many years and twad will probably never be as sophisticated. Though I figured: there are not so many for the terminal. Twad let's you stay in the terminal and on your keyboard as long as possible. Simple as that.

__ALPHA__
This tool is still in very early state.

## Installation

### AUR

An AUR package is planned.

### Manual

```golang
go get -u github.com/zmnpl/twad
```

## Usage

1) Set up your base directory
2) Create games
3) Add mods to your games
4) __Rip and Tear__

## Rofi Mode

You can use [***rofi***](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) or [***dmenu***](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) to launch your games. Run twad like this to use the respective programm. This will open rofi/dmenu and show a list of all games you already have. Select one you want to play and hit enter. Of course this will also track your statistics.
```bash
twad --rofi
# or
twad --dmenu
```
**For instant Rip & Tear:** Bind this to a keyboard shortcut

# twad - terminal wad launcher

![demo](demo.gif)

If you love __DOOM__ and rather not leave your terminal like me, then you might be one of the few that might like **twad**. It is a terminal based WAD manager and launcher for ZDoom engine games. At it's core twad lets you set up a multitude of WAD file combinations, store them and launch them with the press of a button.

There are already great alternatives to manage and launch your WADs out there for many years and twad will probably never be as sophisticated. Though I figured: there are not so many for the terminal. Twad let's you stay in the terminal and on your keyboard as long as possible. Simple as that.

As a little bonus,  twad collects some statistics for you (of course doesn't send them anywhere!) and organizes savegames for each mod combination in a separate folder.

## Watch Out

This tool is still in very early state and might contain bugs.

## Installation

### AUR

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twad-git

### Manually

```golang
go get -u github.com/zmnpl/twad
```

### Binary Download

I'll to add precompiled binaries to the [releases page](https://github.com/zmnpl/twad/releases). It comes without dependencies, just download and run it.

## Initial Config

1) Create a base directory which holds gets to hold all your DOOM files
2) Put your **doom.wad** and **doom2.wad** in that base dir
3) Drop all your mods in here (Subdirectories are of course possible)
4) Within twad create games
5) Add mods to your games
666) __Rip and Tear__


## Rofi Mode

You can use [***rofi***](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) or [***dmenu***](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) to launch your games. Run twad like this to use the respective programm. This will open rofi/dmenu and show a list of all games you already have. Select one you want to play and hit enter. Of course this will also track your statistics.
```bash
twad --rofi
# or
twad --dmenu
```
**For instant Rip & Tear:** Bind this to a keyboard shortcut


## Plans

- ~~Separate savegames folders per game~~
- ~~AUR package~~
- ~~Rofi mode~~
- ~~Help area~~
- ~~Savegame Count~~
- Import for downloaded Zips
- More statistics
- Fading popup highlight where somthing was added
- All the TODO flags

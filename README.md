# twad - terminal wad launcher

![demo](demo.gif)

If you love __DOOM__ and rather not leave your terminal like me, then you might be one of the few that might like **twad**. It is a terminal based WAD manager and launcher for ZDoom engine games. At it's core twad lets you set up a multitude of WAD file combinations, store them and launch them with a couple of key strokes.

There are already great alternatives to manage and launch your WADs out there for many years and twad will probably never be as sophisticated. Though I figured: there are not so many for the terminal. Twad let's you stay in the terminal and on your keyboard as long as possible. Simple as that.

As a little bonus, twad collects some statistics for you (of course doesn't send them anywhere!) and organizes savegames for each mod combination in a separate folder.

## Watch Out

This tool is still in very early state and might contain bugs.

## Installation

### AUR

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twad-git

### Manually

```golang
go get -u github.com/zmnpl/twad
```

### Binary Download

I'll to add precompiled binaries to the [releases page](https://github.com/zmnpl/twad/releases). It comes without dependencies, just download and run it (on *nix systems atm).

## Initial Config

1) Create a base directory which gets to hold all your DOOM files (long time ago, this was known as DOOMWADDIR)
2) Put your **doom.wad** and **doom2.wad** in that base dir
3) Drop all your mods in here (Subdirectories are of course possible)
4) Within twad create games
5) Add mods to your games
666) __Rip and Tear__

## DOOMWADDIR

Your DOOM engine needs to know about the base folder of your mods and IWADs to work properly. Twad's default method for this is to set the ***DOOMWADDIR*** environment variable when starting a game. This is only set for the current game session.

An alternative method is to add paths to the respective source ports config. For *zdoom* ports it could look like this:
```
# in your doom engine .ini
[FileSearch.Directories]
PATH=/home/doomguy/Doom
```

There is flag in the options which lets Twad try to do this automatically for these engines if it finds the respective config:
- **Zandronum** *(~/.config/zandronum/zandronum.ini)*
- **LZDoom** *(~/.config/lzdoom/lzdoom.ini)*
- **GZDoom** *(~/.config/gzdoom/gzdoom.ini)*

If you are using something different, please configure it accoridingly or send in an issue or pull request ;)

## Rofi Mode

You can use [***rofi***](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) or [***dmenu***](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) to launch your games. Run twad like this to use the respective programm. This will open rofi/dmenu and show a list of all games you already have. Select one you want to play and hit enter. Of course this will also track your statistics.
```bash
twad --rofi
# or
twad --dmenu
```
**For instant Rip & Tear:** Bind this to a keyboard shortcut

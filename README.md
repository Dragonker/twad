# twad - terminal wad launcher

![demo](demo.gif)

If you love __DOOM__ and you love your terminal, then twad might be for you. It is a terminal based WAD manager and launcher for ZDoom engine games. At it's core twad lets you set up a multitude of WAD file combinations, store them and launch them with the press of a button.

There are already great alternatives to manage and launch your WADs out there for many years and twad will probably never be as sophisticated. Though I figured: there are not so many for the terminal. Twad let's you stay in the terminal and on your keyboard as long as possible. Simple as that.
